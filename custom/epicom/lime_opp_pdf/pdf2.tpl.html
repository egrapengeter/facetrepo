	<td style="font-size:6.6pt;"><em>First of all and most importantly</em>, we at Lime Painting hold ourselves to a very high standard and will work very hard to ensure that you view our company as a five star paint company. We are confident that you will be pleased with our services upon completion. As always: GET LIMED. 
<p><em>Preparation:</em> All surfaces prepped before application of stain/paint are washed and if necessary select areas are scrubbed with a bristled-brush to remove any excess mildew and algae build up that would interfere with product adhesion. The liquid solution potentially used to prep the surface before application consists of TSP-Trisodium Phosphate (alternative method to power washing). The combination is harmless to the surface, and is used to remove all chalking paint and loose particles as well as remove mildew and algae. This process is necessary to create a healthy and clean surface before the final-product application. Once the surface is washed; any hot spots requiring attention are scrapped to remove flaking product. Sanding is not standard and is an additional cost to the initial quote. Any holes from woodpeckers, carpenter bees, etc. of need, are filled and feather sanded for a smooth appearance. The preparation process is then finalized by caulking all necessary areas to create a full water seal. </p>
<p><em>Application:</em> All top of the line Sherwin Williams’ products are used exclusively unless otherwise quoted. Following the preparation process; the home is left to dry. Usually, the following day is a sufficient period of time to allow the prepped surface to dry sufficiently (unless temperatures dry the surface beforehand). While applying the product, all drip edges are attended to and applied individually to ensure full coverage (this is an important procedure, and is most often over looked or skipped resulting in a bare/porous finish). Any windows, doors, trim, or color differences are then edged for a finished appearance. Spray work is not back rolled unless the surface is porous and back rolling is needed for sufficient adhesion. </p>
<p><em>Deck Preparation:</em> Doesn’t include sanding unless otherwise quoted. Feather sanding refers to sanding splinters, peeling paint (doesn’t refer to eliminating “alligator finishes”). All surface area (that are agreed to be serviced) consisting of: floor boards, railings, spindles, benches, skirting, posts, and lattice work are power washed to remove all dirt, mildew and algae. The power washing process allows high-pressured water to penetrate the pores of the wood removing most unnecessary particles, allowing for a properly bonded product-application. Any protruding wood or unnaturally rough wood (identified during the estimation process) is first scraped, and feather sanded.</p> 
<p><em>Deck Application:</em> All surfaces are sprayed, or rolled, and/or brushed. All edges connecting to the home are edged for a finished appearance. Decks carry no warranty. Concrete (similar substrates i.e., limestone, other stones, etc.) Coating (Pavers, sidewalks, patios, garage floors, etc.): Surface is: power washed to removed loose particles i.e., dirt, mildew, algae, grease, etc., etched to open pores for sufficient coating adhesion, and applied with the designated coating. Surface doesn’t carry a warranty. Standard </p>
<p><em>Work Schedule:</em> For the most part, the paint-crew creates their work schedule. The standard schedule is very tentative and has variance. Monday through Saturday from 9am to 5pm is a relatively accurate projection. In some cases the crew may decide to start at 7am and end at 7pm. It is highly recommended that the client follow us on Facebook to get the latest schedule updates. <em>Please note: no dates are guaranteed</em> due to up sells, unpredictability of production, weather, staff fluctuations, etc. </p>
<p><em>Rain Schedule:</em> The rain season(s) is a difficult time of the year to create a confirmed schedule. In most cases, the rain creates the schedule. Anytime the rain has damped the application surface work will be discontinued, and continued once all moisture on the application surface has evaporated. This can result in project start date delays. What constitutes of a board? A board or per board/panel (as seen on the contract) is defined as any board that is replaced that measures as small as an inch on upward to 8 feet. The variance in price i.e., $38 to $48 per board/panel (Or whatever quoted price provided) is taking into consideration the variance in size (1ft vs. 8ft), difficulty of cut (angle(s), and location of board. In most cases, a project will take on an average price that is applied per board/panel. For example: a flat $36 rate, of which, represents the cost for a board that is an inch and a board that is 8ft – again, it is an average. Note: Sheets consisting of multiple panels are priced based on the panels per sheet not per sheet (this is common with T11 siding). </p>
<p><em>Daily Progress Reports:</em> It is very important to communicate the overall progress and objective for the project. After or prior to most/some days of production, the manager will communicate the progress and process of the project. Lack of communication, however, does not void this contract (it is also upon the client’s responsibility to schedule times for updates). During this time, the homeowner will be walked around the home and given visual of the updates. Any questions or concerns are also addressed. All requests are then communicated throughout the paint crew. </p>
<p><em>Three Year Warranty on Quality of Work:</em> There is a three year warranty on the quality of work for the agreed upon project. If after beginning work, defects or unforeseen conditions arise which could not of been reasonably recognized by the manager upon first inspection, the client agrees to pay an additional charge for the additional work if the client desires the necessary extra work to be done. Otherwise the un-serviced suggested additional work voids the warranty due to the project not being produced to standards sufficient for a three-year warranty. Also, if the homeowner supplies the paint any warranty work is voided. Finally, breakdown due to mildew is not guaranteed, as this is a moisture problem not a paint failure. </p>
<p><em>2nd Coat:</em> If the homeowner requests a lighter color to be applied over a darker color or even a darker color over a lighter color, it is known that the color may not cover in one coat due to the color change. Further, if the color change requires multiple coats due to coverage issues, etc., additional charges are applied for labor and materials. </p> 
<p><em>Colors Quoted:</em> This quote is provided for the home’s existing color combination unless otherwise specified. There are additional costs for additional colors added to the color schemed due to the change in scope of work i.e., labor, materials, product, etc. Previous coat of paint breaks down: If the previous coat of paint beneath the current coat breaks down resulting in a malfunction of the completed painting project, all quality of work warranty is then voided. </p>
<p><em>Sanding:</em> Any work serviced to sand wood doesn’t result in deep mildew stains being removed (Ex: usually around nail heads, gouges, cracks, water prone areas, etc) due to the depth of the stains and the inability to sand a substrate to that depth. Additional failure or unforeseen work necessary that was not originally estimated may be added if warranted by Lime’s team or the homeowner. </p>
<p><em>Lime’s Right to Contract Cancellation:</em> At any particular time, Lime can cancel the contract and in exchange the homeowner will receive a full refund if work has not been serviced. If work has been serviced, a balance for the work serviced is due upon cancelation or the below delinquency of payment conditions apply. Not covered due to unpredictability of weathering/moisture/weathering/high traffic: Deck, patio, concrete coating, any stucco or eifs substrate, window seals, doorframes, rooflines, any surface area that is susceptible to moisture (examples: flat surface, seams, rooflines, etc.). Also, stucco/eifs is not warrantied because a paint coating is intended to maintain the substrate and breakdown or continued failure is a result of instillation or neglect in maintenance or external factors that are out of scope for paint solutions. Lime’s solution of Duration (or alternative paints) is not an elastomeric coating and is recommended due to performance for weathering and not expansion and contraction per elastomeric specifications. Lime’s suggestion to use Duration (or alternative paints) is based on water resistance and sun ware alone and is an attempt to salvage. </p>
<p><em>Homeowner adjustments to finished product:</em> If the homeowner adjusts, adds or alters the finished paint in any way the warranty is voided. If work is agreed upon and completed without being added to the contract, those verbal agreements for work are included at Lime’s quoting standards in the final payment due. If not paid, the upgraded work completed will be considered delinquent. Read below for details. </p>
<p><em>Warranty follow-up season:</em> Services related to warranties are subject to no particular follow up period. Warranties are serviced upon availability of staff, supplies, tools, etc. which vary throughout the year. Your home advisor will provide you with availability dates if need be. </p>
<p><em>Additional conditions:</em> Any deposits collected are non refundable past 3 days of the agreement for painting. If at anytime the client cancels the project prior to starting, there will be a service fee of $250.00. If at any particular time the client decides to cease production, the client is accepting the project as completed and thus the remaining balance is due. Any remaining balance that is not paid is considered delinquent (read below for details). It is also not acceptable for the client to hold onto any collateral or that collateral is considered delinquent (read below for details). If for any particular reason the client feels collateral is due, a settlement can be proposed, or a third party may be necessary (mediation, etc.) to find a reasonable solution. However, the remaining balance is still due or it will be considered delinquent. </p>
<p><em>Please note:</em> Any court fees are taken as the responsibility of the client. Finally, any project protocol related to preparation and application may vary and change, but it does not void this contract. All production will be produced to code. Any delinquent uncollected payments will accrue at an interest rate of 25% annual, compounded monthly (or the highest legal interest rate) and eventually will be reported to the credit bureau. Also, to confirm and register your warranty, please email the following information to warranty@limepainting.com within two weeks of completion of project: Your Name, Address, Phone Number, Manager/Contract Number, Final Cost of Project.</p>
